# EE2008
Here are implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms covered in EE2008.

Topics NOT covered are:
1. Doubly-linked-list
2. Binary-search-tree Deletion
3. Array implementation of Stack & Queue (here we only use LinkedList implementation)
4. Redix sort and Bucket sort
5. Selection by partition
6. Heap

Note that all code are written in C99 standard, except for those in Graph section - they are written in Java SE 8.

For each section, there is likely to be a client.c which contains the main function (except for the Graph, there are probably multiple main functions). For Sortong & Priority Queue, main function has been integrated into each single file.

Also note that I DONOT OWN the `visualization.c` in BST, which helps visualize a Binary Tree (very awesome!). Copyright information is included in the source code.
