# EE2008
Here are implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms covered in EE2008.

Topics NOT covered are:
1. Doubly-linked-list
2. Binary-search-tree Deletion
3. Array implementation of Stack & Queue (here we only use LinkedList implementation)
4. Redix sort and Bucket sort
5. Selection by partition

Note that all algorithms are written in C99 standard, except for those in Graph are written in Java SE8 due to laziness.

For each section, there will likely be a client.c which contains the main function (except for the Graph, there are probably multiple main functions). For Sortong & Priority Queue, main function has been integrated into each single file.

Also note that I DONOT OWN the visualization.c in BST, which helps visualize a Binary Tree. Copyright information is added into the source code.
